# Audio Offset Manager

Audio Offset Manager is a service add-on for Kodi (v20.0+) that dynamically adjusts the audio offset to user configured values based on the currently playing video and audio stream format. By default, Kodi manages audio offsets on an individual video or all video basis. This add-on increases the scope and flexibility of offset management to a per audio/video format basis.

Designed to alleviate frustrations related to decoding times of various audio formats/codecs and video playback synchronization across different home theater setups. This add-on also features an active offset monitoring mode which monitors the audio offset values during playback and saves any changes made by the user back into the configuration setting for that audio/video formatâ€”very useful for initial AV sync calibration across different media types.
